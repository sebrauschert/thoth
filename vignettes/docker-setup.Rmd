## Introduction

Docker containerization is essential for reproducible analytics. `thoth` automatically sets up a Docker environment that matches your local R setup, ensuring that your analysis can be easily shared and reproduced by others.

## Automatic Docker Configuration

When you create a new analytics project with `thoth`, it automatically:

1. Detects your current R version
2. Creates a Dockerfile based on the matching `rocker/rstudio` image
3. Sets up a docker-compose configuration for easy deployment

```r
library(thoth)

# Create new project with Docker enabled
create_analytics_project(
  "my_analysis",
  use_docker = TRUE  # Docker is enabled by default
)
```

## Version Matching

One of the key features of `thoth`'s Docker integration is automatic R version matching:

- The Dockerfile uses exactly the same R version as your local installation
- This ensures that your analysis environment can be perfectly replicated
- Makes it easy to share your complete analysis environment with collaborators

For example, if you're using R 4.3.2, the generated Dockerfile will start with:

```dockerfile
FROM rocker/rstudio:4.3.2
```

## Docker Configuration

The setup creates two key files:

### 1. Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Uses your exact R version
FROM rocker/rstudio:${R_VERSION}

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install DVC
RUN pip3 install dvc

# Create working directory
WORKDIR /project

# Copy project files
COPY . /project/

# Install R packages
RUN R -e 'install.packages("renv")'
RUN R -e 'renv::restore()'

# Set permissions for RStudio user
RUN chown -R rstudio:rstudio /project

# Command to keep the container running
CMD ["/init"]
```

### 2. docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  rstudio:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8787:8787"
    environment:
      - PASSWORD=rstudio
      - ROOT=TRUE
    volumes:
      - .:/project
    user: rstudio
```

## Using the Docker Environment

### Starting the Environment

```bash
# From your project directory
docker-compose up -d
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8787` in your browser:
- Username: rstudio
- Password: rstudio

### Stopping the Environment

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Benefits of Version-Matched Containers

1. **Perfect Reproducibility**
   - Exact same R version as development
   - All dependencies installed automatically
   - System-level configurations matched

2. **Easy Sharing**
   - Share your complete analysis environment
   - Recipients don't need to match your R setup
   - Just need Docker installed

3. **Collaboration**
   - Team members can run identical environments
   - No "works on my machine" problems
   - Consistent results across systems

4. **Long-term Preservation**
   - Archive the exact environment with your analysis
   - Future-proof your work
   - Easy to spin up years later

## Example Workflow

1. **Development**
   ```r
   # Create project with Docker
   create_analytics_project("analysis", use_docker = TRUE)
   
   # Work on your analysis locally
   # All dependencies are tracked in renv.lock
   ```

2. **Sharing**
   ```bash
   # Share your project including docker/ directory
   git push origin main
   
   # Recipients can simply:
   git clone <repository>
   cd <repository>
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Collaboration**
   ```r
   # Team members can work in identical environments
   # Regardless of their local R setup
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Keep Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in version control
   - Update them when dependencies change
   - Document any custom modifications

2. **Testing**
   - Regularly test the Docker build
   - Verify that analysis runs in container
   - Check for reproducibility

3. **Documentation**
   - Document any special setup requirements
   - Include Docker-specific instructions in README
   - Note system requirements

## Customization

You can customize the Docker setup by modifying:

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Add system dependencies
   - Install additional tools
   - Modify environment settings

2. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Change port mappings
   - Add environment variables
   - Configure volumes

## Conclusion

`thoth`'s Docker integration with automatic R version matching ensures that your analytics projects are:
- Perfectly reproducible
- Easy to share
- Future-proof
- Collaboration-ready

By automatically creating a Docker environment that matches your development setup, `thoth` removes the complexity of environment management while ensuring your analysis can be reproduced exactly as intended.
